# Anisotropic Heterogeneous Volumes

An Unreal Engine plugin to help with importing and rendering anisotropic heterogeneous Volumes.
Introduces an AnisotropicHeterogeneousVolumeComponent, which adds additional parameters to control the anisotropy of the media.

**This plugin requires my custom engine branch as shader and pipeline modifications to the core engine are required. My branch can be found [here](https://github.com/jambuttenshaw/UnrealEngine/tree/volumetrics)**.

## MiePlotImporter
A tool to import phase function data exported from MiePlot as a LUT texture in Unreal Engine. Also projects the imported phase function to two-band Zonal Harmonics.
